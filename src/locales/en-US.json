  "homeBioSection": "Hi there!\n\nI'm Amanda Dee (she/her) - a bicoastal (SF/Bay Area and NYC) pianist, violinist, and music director. I am working towards branching into professional theatre as a music director and pit musician.\n\nOne of my main musical passions is youth programming, which I have done extensively with Berkeley Playhouse (Berkeley, CA) and American Conservatory Theatre (San Francisco, CA). I also play and music direct for companies such as SF Playhouse (San Francisco, CA), Ray of Light Theatre (San Francisco, CA), UC Berkeley BareStage (Berkeley, CA), Pinole Players (Pinole, CA), and Pittsburg Theater Company (Pittsburg, CA).\n\nDuring my college years, I dabbled in directing, music directing, pit directing, performing, and playing in pit orchestras for 18 productions through my college theater company. During that time, I directed/music directed the first collegiate production of Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812. I also music directed a regional production of tick…tick…BOOM! with A Common Thread Theatre Company (Framingham, MA) while completing my undergraduate capstone on carbon sequestration in hydroponic crops.\n\nI have my BS in Bioengineering with minors in Music and Mathematics (Northeastern University) and am a PhD candidate in Plant Biology (UC Berkeley).\n\nI love meeting new people and finding new collaborators. I am open to a variety of work, though my expertise is in music directing, accompanying, and vocal coaching. Please don't hesitate to inquire about my availability.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",
